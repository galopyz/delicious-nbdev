    "I was lucky and got an opportunity to use solveit since late 2024 when the [course](https://solveit.fast.ai) began. Solveit is similar to Jupyter notebook with code, note, and raw type of messages, and Python is used for the code. However, it also has prompt messages which the users can prompt Claude. Solveit is different from other AI assisted coding because it encourages solveit method. Solveit method is about working in small batches for rapid iteration. When coding, write a small chunk, fully understand what it does and look at its output before moving on. This is opposite of what other coding agents do. They tend to create a plan and get the job done with a lot of code. "

    "Before we dive into problem solving, let's take a look at solveit method. The method is about working on a task in small chunk, finish it before moving on. How does it help? Here is an analogy. Let's think about coding as cooking and any other AI agents that's not solveit as cooking assistants. If AI agents are cooking assistants and the users are the chefs, when the chef asks to cook pizza, the assistants try to finish the cooking and come up with pizza. They create plans and get to work until pizza is finished. However, solveit does not start cooking. It encourages the chef to cook together. It asks many clarifying questions to set the clear goal. What kind of pizza to cook? Which ingredients to use? How to bake the pizza? When cooking, solveit does it step by step and waits for the chef for an approval. It would only prepare ingredients first so the chef can take a look and taste them. If the tomatoes are not fresh enough, we can fix it right then instead of cooking the whole pizza and finding out the tomatoes were bad. And it is easier to find out that the tomatoes were bad before the pizza is finished, and it also saves time and resources. See how working on small steps can speedup the process? "

    "Solveit helps the users to use this method as it only responds with small code blocks. It is also easy to stay focused. In the beginning of the solveit course, we learned about Polya's [method](https://gist.github.com/jph00/d60301884c56fe063101a7cc6193b3af) for problem solving. Here is a brief summary. \n",

We think about how we are going to solve a problem. We can look for similar problems we solved before that might be helpful. We can also break down complex problem into smaller ones. Third, we carry out the plan. We work on the plan step by step making sure each step is correct. Lastly, we look back and reflect. How can we do better? What other ways to solve the problem?"

    "So how do we apply solveit method? The best way to learn is to get my hands dirty by solving problems. Using this method, solveit and I solved an [element spelling problem](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/main/ipynb/ElementSpelling.ipynb) from pytude. Here is a [gist](https://gist.github.com/galopyz/1fd51a5a615ce223d0f2af7eb8209f13) of a dialogue. It is easy to export a dialogue into a gist in solveit, so gist is a common way to share dialogues. The dialogue starts off with importing libraries and tools. In solveit, I can use ampersand backticks (&`function_name`) syntax with a function name for solveit to use for tool use. So, I can ask solvit to read messages with &`read_msg` and make a summary then add a message with $`add_msg`. Those functions are defined inside of [dialoghelper](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/dialoghelper). Then I download the \"answer key\" from the git repo and store it inside of $`ans` variable. Another useful syntax in solveit is dollar sign backtick, ($`variable_name`) with a variable name. Solveit can see what's inside of the variable. Therefore, solveit knows the answer to the coding problem and help me solve the problem. "

    "After setting up the dialogue to make our lives easier, I added the problem. After reading and understanding the problem, I came up with a plan to solve it and asked solveit how it looks. The lines after `🤖Reply🤖` are solveit's response. Here is what it looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "🤖Reply🤖\n",
    "Your plan is on the right track, but let me help you think through it a bit more carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at your plan, I can see you're thinking about a recursive approach, which is great! However, there are a couple of things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your first point about empty strings returning True makes sense - if we've consumed all the letters, we've successfully spelled the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For the second point, when you say \"go through keys in elements\" - what order will you check them in? And what happens if multiple element symbols could match the beginning of your remaining string?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Your third point about \"no more keys left\" - when exactly would this happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you think about what might go wrong with this approach? For example, what would happen with a word like \"in\" - should it be spelled as \"In\" (Indium) or \"I\" + \"N\" (Iodine + Nitrogen)?\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think about these questions?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Solveit wanted me to think more carefully about each case. And we asked each other more questions until I thought it was enough and went ahead with execution of plans. Another cool thing I could have done was edit the responses from solveit to however I wanted. If I thought solveit was not asking right questions, I could change the response. Because of autoregressive nature of language models, subsequent responses follow the pattern from the earlier responses. If I don't like how solveit genearated code, I could change its response. I could add more comments for the responded code, or none. Another way to change the response from solveit is by using different modes. There are standard, learning, and concise modes. Standard is the normal way, learning mode asks questions to help the user think, and concise mode follows solveit method of coding small lines at a time. If I just wanted to fix a bug that I was familiar with, I could've changed it to concise mode, which skips all the asking questions and directly solving the problem with concise code and responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "In execution stage, I coded small chunk and looking at the output until I got the working example then wrapped it as a function. Coming up with `spellable` was fairly simple, so I was able to do it in less steps. However in the later dialogue, I was wrting `find_all_matches`, and I went through a lot more trial and errors. I deleted many misleading approaches to keep myself from getting confused along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "After coming up with an implementation that worked, it was time for a reflection. Talking to solveit about how to improve my code, other approaches I could take, learning about other ways to solve helped me a lot to understand the problem deeply. I could simplify my code a lot. And thinking about different approaches with time and space complexity was beneficial to choosing certain design, too."

    "This way of using AI to solve a coding problem was very new to me. Other AI agents and models I used gladly wrote down the code for me, which was very easy for me. However, I didn't learn anything out of it. Using solveit, I had to actively think a lot about what I was doing on each step, and it took a lot of work and time. To solve this problem, I spent a few hours for several days everyday. This might be a skill issue for me. I could come up with different cases I had to handle, but I had a difficult time coming up with how to combine the results from recursive calls. What to do when there was no match to the element spelling? How do I combine all the possible spellings? I was happy to figure out how to put it all together into a working solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection also took a lot of brain power. However, learning about different ways to solve problems and thinking about pros and cons was fun. In my experience, solveit was a very slow way to learn how to code. But it was a challenging and fun. "

However, the cards were not how I would have made them. Some cards were too simple or some were too detailed. With those tools, I could not customize my decks.

    "I also tried using solveit to help me with reading academic papers. Here is a [dialogue](https://gist.github.com/galopyz/2476e7290e4ccb72aec73432cf37a723) for reading Tulu3 paper. I wanted to read each section and ask questions to clarify my understanding. I had many questions when reading questions, and solveit was very good at explaining. When I tried with other platforms, they tend to respond with so much text and information, which exhausted me a lot. I just wanted them to answer my question concisely without repeating what I just said without other related facts. \n",

In this [dialogue](https://gist.github.com/galopyz/7cdcc7e9d539cdea2be6b5a23ea2ee7b), I was reading deepseek math with the markdown. Then I asked solveit to come up with a function to split markdown by headings so I could read section by section and ask questions. However, the library had trouble converting some pdfs into markdown with correct headings. And mathematical expressions were not rendered correctly. Even from those drawbacks, it was very helpful to read papers with solveit's help."

    "With a recent update, we can also deploy FastHTML apps from solveit. Here is a [dialogue](https://gist.github.com/galopyz/d9f25f007a1132b2058ac1b339eaa545) on how I deployed a todo app from solveit. To make the existing apps work inside of solveit, some adjustments need to be made. First, serve FastHTML app with `nb_serve` and change routes from `/` into something else as solveit uses it. In this dialogue, I changed it to `/hp` for home page, and when I check `https://whatever_secret_stuff.solveit.fast.ai/hp` after serving the app, I could see the todo app running. Even when building a FastHTML app, solveit method applies. Building one component or a feature at a time and then looking at it and testing it. In the dialogue, we used `render_ft()` to render each component, and using `qshow` on components applies css styling as well. So, whenver we output a component, we get a fully working component with style that we could try out. "
