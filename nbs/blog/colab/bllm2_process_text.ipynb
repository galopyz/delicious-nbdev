Second, we build the dataloader. Lastly, we turn it into embeddings. As a bonus, we will also go over byte pair encoding in the end. Materials for this blog are from chapter 2 of \"Build a Large Language Model From Scratch\" by Sebastian Raschka with some adjustments. And the images and code are from the book and the author's [github repo](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main/ch02)."

    "We will use `tiktoken` library to get an encoding from gpt2. We've pretty much looked at everything in this code except stride. `max_length` is the context size. `stride` is the number of tokens to skip when creating the next sequence. For example, if `max_length` is 4 and `stride` is 2, then the next sequence will start 2 tokens after the previous sequence. This is to avoid having the same sequence in the dataset multiple times. This is a common technique in NLP. It is called sliding window. It is also called sliding window attention. By avoiding the same sequence multiple times, we can reduce the size of the dataset. This is important because we want to use as much data as possible to train the model. It also reduces overfitting."

    "## What Are Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding is a way to represent words or phrases as vectors of numbers. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the words, allowing us to perform mathematical operations on them. For example, we can calculate the distance between two words to see how similar they are. Embeddings are used in many NLP tasks, such as machine translation, text classification, and question answering. They are also used in recommendation systems, image recognition, and other machine learning tasks. Embeddings are a powerful tool for understanding and processing text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in this space:\n",
    "- \"Cat\" and \"dog\" might be close together because they're both pets\n",
    "- \"Run\" and \"sprint\" would be nearby as they're similar actions\n",
    "- \"Hot\" might be positioned opposite to \"cold\"\n",
    "- \"King\", \"queen\", \"prince\", and \"princess\" would form a cluster showing both their royal relationships and gender differences\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern LLMs like GPT-2, each token (word or subword) is represented by a vector of 768 numbers, while larger models like GPT-3 use even bigger vectors (2048 or more dimensions). These numbers aren't randomly assigned - they're learned during training to capture meaningful relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Embeddings?\n",
    "Traditional one-hot encoding represents each word as a vector of zeros with a single '1', where the vector length equals vocabulary size. For a 50,000-word vocabulary, each word requires a 50,000-dimensional vector! This approach has several major problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inefficiency:\n",
    "   - Massive storage requirements\n",
    "   - Sparse representations (mostly zeros)\n",
    "   - Computationally expensive to process\n",
    "\n",
    "2. No Semantic Information:\n",
    "   - \"cat\" and \"kitten\" are as different as \"cat\" and \"motorcycle\"\n",
    "   - No way to measure word similarity\n",
    "   - No capture of analogies or relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings solve these problems by:\n",
    "1. Dense Representation:\n",
    "   - Using much smaller vectors (768 vs 50,000 dimensions)\n",
    "   - Every dimension carries meaningful information\n",
    "   - Efficient storage and computation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Semantic Relationships:\n",
    "   - Similar words have similar vectors\n",
    "   - Enable amazing arithmetic: king - man + woman ≈ queen\n",
    "   - Capture multiple types of relationships:\n",
    "     * Semantic (car/automobile)\n",
    "     * Syntactic (run/running)\n",
    "     * Conceptual (France/Paris :: Japan/Tokyo)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Learning and Adaptation:\n",
    "   - Embeddings improve during model training\n",
    "   - Can capture domain-specific meanings\n",
    "   - Transfer learning from one task to another\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Mathematical Operations:\n",
    "   - Calculate similarity using cosine distance\n",

    "Byte pair encoding (BPE) is a data compression technique that is used to create a vocabulary of subword units. It was a bit confusing for me to understand this because I didn't know about bytes, hexdecimal, ASCII, and UTF-8. We can just think of byte as a tiny thing that makes up a character. The algorithm is very simple. It works by iteratively merging the most frequent pair of bytes in the text. This process is repeated until the desired vocabulary size is reached. The resulting vocabulary consists of the most frequent subword units in the text. \n",
    "\n",
    "The book does not cover details of BPE, but [bpe-from-scratch](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main/ch02/05_bpe-from-scratch) is included in the github. This version focuses on education purposes and skips some steps, such as converting the text into bytes. To learn more about bpe, I recommend [`minbpe`](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe) by Karpathy. The code has many comments and is easy to understand."

Instead of writing eight characters long for each byte, we can use hexadecimal to write two characters for each byte. In simple terms, ASCII is an old way to convert or convert back a byte into a character and only has characters on english keyboard, such as english alphabet, numbers, +, -, etc. UTF-8 is modern way that includes characters from other languages and emojis. Using hexadecimal is useful because UTF-8 uses multiple bytes. \n",

    "1. Vocabulary is initialized with first 256 ASCII characters.\n",
    "2. Text is converted into bytes.\n",
    "3. Until vocabulary size is reached:\n",

I was planning on explaining BPE in more detail, but I think it is better to leave it as an exercise for the reader. Maybe I will write a blog on it in the future with some information about bytes, hexadecimal digits, ASCII, UTF-8, and such. Of course it is not necessary to understand BPE, but they are related and are fun to learn about."
