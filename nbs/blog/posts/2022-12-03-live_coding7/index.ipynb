    "Kaggle is a great place to practice hands on machine learning skills. There are many different competitions anybody can participate. And there are many different types of data available, such as medical images, satellite images, texts, and more. Some competitions are just for fun and learning, but there are also more practical competitions that can help ongoing research or improving products. It's also a great place to discuss strategies with others. "

    "Kaggle has notebooks available with GPUs like Colab, so it is possible to study machine learning on it. However, they do not have persistent storage. Also, Kaggle's auto complete did not really work well for me. So, I would rather write notebooks on paperspace and submit it on Kaggle. Another good thing about using Paperspace is that Kaggle has GPU limits, but Paperspace doesn't. So, let's set up Kaggle on paperspace!"
