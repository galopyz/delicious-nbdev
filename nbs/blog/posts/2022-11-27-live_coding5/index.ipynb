    "`Vim` is a great tool because of availability on command line interface and its power. Some editors, such as VS code, do not run on terminal. Therefore, if we want to edit files in paperspace, we have to use something that runs in this environment. There are [nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano), [emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs), `vim`, and more. `Nano` is good for starting out because it has commands on the bottom of the screen. However, it is not as powerful as `emacs` and `vim`. We will learn about `vim`. "
